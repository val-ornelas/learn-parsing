the easiest way to run this program is as follows 
1 download the listed  files basic.py, shell.py, strings_with_arrows.py
2 open up a terminal and run shell.py (python3 shell.py)
3 when it says "basic > " you can input what ypu want the code to do 
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
LIST OF  CURRENT COMMANDS THE PROGRAM CAN FOLLOW 
 "+" is  addition so if you type in x + y sum of those two numbers 

"-" is subratraction so it will return the remander of two numbers 

"*" is multiplication so it will return the product of two numbers 

"/" is division so it will return the qotent of two numbers 
 
 "^" is for powers so it will return with what x to the power of y is 
 
 "#" makes a comment it works like it does in python

"=="checks to see if two numbers are equal(1= true 0=false)
"!="checks to see if two numbers are notequal(1= true 0=false)basic
"<"checks to see if one number is less than another (1= true 0=false)
">"checks to see if one number is greater than another (1= true 0=false)
"<="checks to see if one number is less or equal to  than another (1= true 0=false)
">="checks to see if one number is greater or equal to  than another (1= true 0=false)
you can use multiple functions within the line (ie 2 + 4 *3^5) and it will follow P.E.M.D.A.S 

you can add a string by uskng double quotes ie "hello world"
you can add strings together ie "hello" + " world" 
result  hello world

you can multiply strings ie "hi " * 3 
result hi hi hi 
by typing in "VAR" then a letter or word  then "=" and a number you can create a variable that can be used in later calculations

"AND" allows for and operations to be done

"OR allows for or operations to be done 

"IF" allows for an if statement 

"ELIF" acts as another "IF" 

"Then" is required after an "IF" or an "ELIF" to create a second condition 

"ELSE" can be added at the end of a final line so that it will still return soemthing if no previous "IF" or "ELIF" statemens return true you do NOT need to add "THEN" after an "Else"

"FOR" acts simialr to how it does in basic,to do it you type "FOR variable name  = starting value TO ending value THEN result 
"WHILE" used as "WHILE" condition THEN result

ALWAYS BE SURE TO CALL A VARIABLE AFTER A LOOP SO YOU CAN SEE THE RESULT 

"FUN" lets the user call a function, to use it you have to type in FUN <function name> (ammount of inputs the user has to enter) -> <result of function>
 to call on the function you have to calll <function name>(your inputs)

 [ ] makses a list in order to add things  into the list you have to typoe in the numbers followed by a comma 
 to append to the list first you type the list name then + then the number you want to add to the list 
 
 / allows you to pull the number located at a specfic index 
 
 * concatonates lists
 
 PRINT() prints a string 
 PRINT_INT() prints an intiger 
 IS_NUM//STR/FUN/LIST() checks to see ifsomething is a function or list (etc)
 APPEND() appends to a list 
 POP ()takes from a list 
 EXTEND() concatonates two lists 
 MATH_PI prints digits of pi 
 RETURN returns a what you tell it to 
 CONTINUE in a loop use continue to skip a specfic number (ie if i == 4  CONTINUE) 
 BREAK stops a loop (ie if i == 8 Break)
 RUN() lets you run a file name 
 LEN() returns the length of a list 
 __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
 to use muti line statements end one line with ';' 
to run a file you have to make the file first the run python3 shell.py  when it returns "basic < " type in "RUN(" file name")
 
this current state of code is mostly following the youtube tutoril By CODE Pulse That you can find at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZQftyCk7_SdoVexSmwy_tBgs7P0b97yD whos in trun was inspired on https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/later in  later renditions  i aim to have my own code that allow any user to create and sort, search trough their own lists without having to write special algorithims as well as allow the user to do the same calculations with lists as they can with normal numbers/variables
