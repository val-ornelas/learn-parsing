the easiest way to run this program is as follows 
1 download the listed  files basic.py, shell.py, strings_with_arrows.py
2 open up a terminal and run shell.py (python3 shell.py)
3 when it says "basic > " you can input what ypu want the code to do 
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
LIST OF  CURRENT COMMANDS THE PROGRAM CAN FOLLOW 
 "+" is  addition so if you type in x + y sum of those two numbers 

"-" is subratraction so it will return the remander of two numbers 

"*" is multiplication so it will return the product of two numbers 

"/" is division so it will return the qotent of two numbers 
 
 "^" is for powers so it will return with what x to the power of y is 

"=="checks to see if two numbers are equal(1= true 0=false)
"!="checks to see if two numbers are notequal(1= true 0=false)basic
"<"checks to see if one number is less than another (1= true 0=false)
">"checks to see if one number is greater than another (1= true 0=false)
"<="checks to see if one number is less or equal to  than another (1= true 0=false)
">="checks to see if one number is greater or equal to  than another (1= true 0=false)
you can use multiple functions within the line (ie 2 + 4 *3^5) and it will follow P.E.M.D.A.S 

by typing in "VAR" then a letter or word  then "=" and a number you can create a variable that can be used in later calculations
"AND" allows for and operations to be done
"OR allows for or operations to be done
